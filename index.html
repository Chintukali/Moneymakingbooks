The book outlines Graham’s value investing strategy and principles for successful stock market investing.

He also stresses the importance of diversification, proper research and the need to have a clear understanding of the risks associated with each investment. 
                    The Intelligent Investor is packed with invaluable advice on how to build a portfolio of investments and manage it for long-term success. It is an essential read for any investor who wants to ensure that their money is being invested wisely and securely.
